# README
- main.py looks at the current dataset, and collect only those that have been written/edited after gpt-4o was released
- get_all_recent_lines.py looks at a project, and collects all the lines that are written/edited after gpt-4o was released
- get_raw_cov.py takes in the result from get_all_recent_lines.py to get the raw coverage data (just like what ../manually_labelled.py will produce) that needs to be manually labelled
